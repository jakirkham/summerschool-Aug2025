For most students, your flights and lodging were direct billed to Oregon

travel stipend to cover miscellaneous travel expenses incurred during the
school.
If you choose, you may instead opt to do a reimbursement process for your flight and travel expenses. 
 
You should register as an individual, add your SSN, and then upload a filled W-9 form (though you will not actually be taxed for the reimbursement).
Please make sure you complete this ASAP!

  - On the next page, if you drove to Fairbanks, AK, add the dates and mileage to the "Personal Vehicle Mileage" section.
  - In the "Other Travel Expenses" section, add your airfare (if you paid for flights yourself) or ground transportation costs (such as train, bus, public transit). Note that we will not reimburse for Lyft/Uber/taxi from the airports to the hotel, unless the Metro was not available.
  - If you run out of space in "Ground Transportation", you can use the "Other" lines.
  - Use "Parking" if you parked at your home airport (we only allow economy parking).
