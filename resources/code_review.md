# Code review resources

## Personal comments:

* Most importantly, code review is not a paper review.
Its primary goal, almost always, is to make the code a better fit, better for future maintenance and useability.


* There is no one size fits all rules for code review.

* Projects may have different checklicks and review guides. Follow them when they exist.

* Generally, be nice. You may know the person who contributes, but there are others who may just read your interactions and don't know personal contexts.

TL;DR -- Code reviewing is not trivial, be nice during the process.
